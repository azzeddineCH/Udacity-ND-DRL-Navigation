    "The agent first interacts with the environment randomly, and collects experience data in the tuple form of state, action, reward, next state, end-of-episode. These experiences are then stored at the agent's memory which is a deque object with a max size of BUFFER_SIZE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning happens when the agent samples experience data from it's memory, and uses it's qnetwork_local network's optimizer (Adam optimizer in this project) to minimizes the MSE error between the Q-values predicted by the network and the true rewards received by the agent in the Temperal Difference fashion. This is implemented in the learn() function of the Agent class in the agent.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent gradually decreases it's liklihood of chosing random actions, and exploits the knowledge learned by the qnetwork_local by chosing the action with the maximum Q-value. This allows the agent to fine tune the Q-value predictions produced by the neural network. The likelihood of the agent's random action is the eps variable in below training algorithm, which decreases exponentially with a factor of eps_decay in the training process.\n",
